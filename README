INSTALLATION

    To do a system-wide installation:
        $ sudo python setup.py install    

    To do a single-user installation:
        $ python setup.py install --home ~
    You must have ~/bin on $PATH, and ~/lib/python on $PYTHONPATH

    For more installation options, use
        $ python setup.py --help
    or refer to Installing Python Modules, http://docs.python.org/dist/

    Aethertool can also be used "in place" without installation.
    

USAGE

    For help with commandline options, use "aethertool.py -h".  For help on the
    configuration syntax, use "aethertool.py -c help".


BUGS

    Aethertool assumes that your browser is called "firefox"; it should use
    the webbrowser module instead

    Aethertool assumes the command used to invoke the editor doesn't exit
    until the user is done editing the file.  This can cause problems if the
    editor naturally starts in the background.

    If the user does a 'write and exit' sequence, the file the browser loads
    to submit page changes may be removed too early, and the last edit lost.
